# Backend Agent Logs - Phase 1

## Problem-Solving Methodology

### Triage Process
1. **Identify Symptoms**
   - Collect error messages
   - Note visual/functional issues
   - Document when the problem started

2. **Analyze Recent Changes**
   - Review recent code changes
   - Check directory structure modifications
   - Verify configuration updates

3. **Isolate the Scope**
   - Determine affected components
   - Check if issue is global or localized
   - Identify related systems (auth, styling, etc.)

4. **Test Hypotheses**
   - Start with simplest explanation
   - Make minimal changes to test
   - Verify if issue is reproducible

5. **Document Learnings**
   - Record root cause
   - Note solution steps
   - Update patterns/anti-patterns

Example:
Recent Payload Admin Panel issue:
- Symptom: Hydration mismatch
- Recent Change: Directory restructure
- Scope: Layout system conflict
- Solution: Remove root layout
- Learning: Route groups need independent layouts

## Completed Tasks

### Payload CMS Setup
1. **Core Installation**
   - Integrated Payload CMS 3.0
   - Configured admin panel
   - Set up database connection

2. **Collections**
   - Implemented Users collection
   - Created Projects collection
   - Set up Media handling

### Database Integration
1. **Vercel Postgres**
   - Configured connection pooling
   - Set up migrations system
   - Implemented type-safe queries

2. **Schema Design**
   - Created initial database schema
   - Set up relationships
   - Implemented indexes

### API Development
1. **Endpoints**
   - Projects API routes
   - Media upload handling
   - Authentication endpoints

2. **Type Generation**
   - Automated type generation
   - Collection type definitions
   - API response types

## Technical Decisions
- Used Vercel Postgres for scalability
- Implemented connection pooling
- Chose Payload for admin flexibility
- Maintained TypeScript throughout

## Challenges Resolved
1. **Database Setup**
   - Fixed migration issues
   - Resolved connection pooling
   - Optimized query performance

2. **Type Integration**
   - Automated type generation
   - Fixed import issues
   - Maintained type safety

3. **Authentication Setup**
   - Resolved Clerk middleware detection issue
   - Fixed auth() function configuration
   - Maintained proper middleware setup in src directory
   - Learned to verify existing configurations before changes
   - Documented working patterns for future reference

4. **Payload Admin Panel**
   - Identified and fixed hydration mismatch in admin panel
   - Root cause: Custom meta configuration interfering with Payload's built-in styling system
   - Solution: Maintain default admin configuration without custom meta settings
   - Learning: Payload admin has its own styling system that shouldn't be customized at config level

5. **Layout Architecture**
   - Resolved layout conflicts by implementing independent layouts for each route group
   - Removed root layout.tsx to prevent interference with Payload admin
   - Each route group ((public), (app), (payload)) has its own complete HTML structure
   - Proper authentication boundaries:
     * (public): Optional Clerk auth with public navigation
     * (app): Enforced Clerk auth with protected routes
     * (payload): Independent Payload CMS auth
   - Learning: In Next.js route groups, independent layouts provide better isolation and prevent auth/styling conflicts

## Next Phase Preparation
1. **Planned Features**
   - User authentication flow
   - Role-based access control
   - Advanced querying capabilities

2. **Improvements**
   - Enhanced error handling
   - Query optimization
   - Caching strategy

## Common Patterns

### Payload CMS Data Fetching

When implementing data fetching for Payload CMS collections:

```typescript
// Standard pattern for fetching collection items
async function getCollectionItem(id: string) {
  const payload = await getPayloadClient()
  return await payload.findByID({
    collection: 'collection-name',
    id,
  })
}
```

Key points:
- Use the singleton `getPayloadClient`
- Let Payload handle type safety
- Keep data fetching logic simple
- Trust Payload's built-in error handling
- Use collection-specific types from `payload-types.ts`

### Next.js 15 and Payload Integration

When working with Payload CMS in Next.js 15 dynamic routes:

```typescript
// Pattern for handling dynamic routes with Payload
async function getProjectData(id: string) {
  const payload = await getPayloadClient()
  const project = await payload.findByID({
    collection: 'projects',
    id,
  })
  return project
}

// Usage in Next.js 15 page
export default async function ProjectPage({
  params,
}: {
  params: Promise<{ id: string }>
}) {
  const { id } = await params
  const project = await getProjectData(id)
  
  if (!project) {
    return notFound()
  }
  
  return { project }
}
```

Key points:
- Always use getPayloadClient() for singleton instance
- Handle Promise-based params in Next.js 15
- Implement proper error handling
- Keep data fetching logic separate from UI
- Use type-safe collection names
