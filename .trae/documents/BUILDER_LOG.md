# BUILDER\_LOG.md ‚Äî NUTRIA MACRO

## 2024-12-19 ‚Äî 15:30

### üî® Changes

* Created comprehensive Product Requirements Document (`nutria-macro-prd.md`)

* Generated Technical Architecture Document (`nutria-macro-technical-architecture.md`)

* Established PROJECT\_CONTEXT.md as living project contract

* Initialized BUILDER\_LOG.md for execution tracking

* Defined complete component hierarchy and file structure

* Specified data models and TypeScript interfaces

### üß† Rationale

Starting with thorough documentation ensures clear project vision and technical direction.
The PRD establishes user requirements and feature specifications, while the technical architecture provides implementation guidance.
PROJECT\_CONTEXT.md serves as a single source of truth for project state, and this log maintains historical context.

### ‚úÖ Results

* Complete documentation suite created in `.trae/documents/`

* Project scope and technical approach clearly defined

* Component architecture and data models specified

* Development roadmap established with clear phases

* Dark theme design system documented

### üéØ Next Steps

* Implement React frontend structure with specified file organization

* Create initial components (Header, MealBuilderSection, SummarySection)

* Develop UI components library (Card, Button, Icons)

* Populate with mock data from constants.ts

* Set up TailwindCSS styling and dark theme

* Test responsive layout and component interactions

### üìã Technical Decisions Made

* React 19 + TypeScript for type safety and modern features

* TailwindCSS via CDN for rapid styling without build complexity

* ES6 modules with importmap for browser-native module loading

* Component-based architecture with clear separation of concerns

* Static data initially, with clear migration path to Supabase backend

* Dark theme with sky-blue accents for professional appearance

### üîç Architecture Highlights

* Single-page application with sticky navigation and summary panels

* Responsive grid layout (3 columns on large screens, single column on mobile)

* Calculated macros using useMemo for performance optimization

* Reusable UI components with variant support

* Clear data flow from App.tsx to child components via props
