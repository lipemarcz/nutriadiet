## üìã Usage Instructions

### Basic Agent Usage

To use any agent in Claude Code, include the agent instruction in your prompt:

```
Use the [agent-name] agent to [specific task]
```

### Task Dispatch Director Examples

The Task Dispatch Director is particularly powerful for complex, multi-step projects:

#### Example 1: Full-Stack Feature Development
```
Use the task-dispatch-director agent to help me implement a complete user authentication system for my web app. I need user registration, login, password reset, and profile management features.
```

### Individual Agent Examples

#### QA Engineer
```
Use the qa-engineer agent to analyze the test coverage in my project and create a comprehensive testing strategy for my React application.
```

#### Code Review Expert
```
Use the code-review-expert agent to perform a security audit of my authentication middleware and identify potential vulnerabilities.
```

#### Technical Solution Architect
```
Use the technical-solution-architect agent to design a scalable microservices architecture for my social media application.
```

#### Technical Researcher
```
Use the technical-researcher agent to research the best database solutions for handling real-time chat functionality in my messaging app.
```

#### Flask API Developer
```
Use the flask-api-developer agent to implement a complete user management API with JWT authentication and role-based access control.
```


## üí° Best Practices

### 1. Be Specific with Context
Provide clear context about your project, technology stack, and requirements:
```
Use the task-dispatch-director agent to help me migrate my PHP monolith to a Node.js microservices architecture. The current system handles 10k daily users and includes user management, payment processing, and content delivery.
```

### 2. Combine Agents for Complex Tasks
The Task Dispatch Director can coordinate other agents:
```
Use the task-dispatch-director agent to coordinate a complete code review and optimization of my project. I want security analysis, performance improvements, and test coverage enhancement.
```

### 3. Provide Relevant Files and Structure
When possible, mention key files or project structure:
```
Use the flask-api-developer agent to refactor my API in app.py. I want to implement the repository pattern and separate concerns into models, services, and controllers.
```

## üîß Troubleshooting

### Agent Not Found
If Claude Code agent is not found:
1. Verify installation: `ls ~/.claude/agents`
2. Re-run the installer: `./install.sh`
3. Check file permissions: `chmod 644 ~/.claude/agents/*.md`

### Agent Not Responding as Expected
- Be more specific in your prompt
- Provide additional context about your project
- Try rephrasing your request
